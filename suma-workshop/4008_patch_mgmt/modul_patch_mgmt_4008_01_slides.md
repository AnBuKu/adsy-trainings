# SUSE Manager 3 - Patch Management

## Agenda

* Patch Day

* Emergency Patches

## Patch Day

The common workflow is to merge one channel with an other one. So you have to merge the vendor channels with your test channels, to upgrade the software packages on your SLES test systems.

If all tests on your SLES test systems passed successfully, you can go ahead and merge the test channels with the production channel, and upgrade your SLES production systems.
