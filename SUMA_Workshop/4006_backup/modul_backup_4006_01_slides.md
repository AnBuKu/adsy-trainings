## BTRFS Snapshots

By default, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is set up using Btrfs and snapshots for the root partition. Snapshots allow you to easily roll back your system if needed after applying updates, or to back up files.

## File Systems Backup

It's recommended to backup all (local) file systems!

## Database Backup

* For local database backups SUSE provides the `smdba` command.

* Hot Backup

* Cold Backup
